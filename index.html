        <p>Our pastry chefs know how to make good cookies. We don't use anything unnatural and we can give you a tour on
            how it's made. More on that in the Process.</p>

                We also serve more than just cookies; we make malts, milkshakes, and ice cream as well!

                Due to a supply shortage, our former item of macharons are no longer available until further notice.
                Thank you for your patience!
